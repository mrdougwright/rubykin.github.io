title: About  Doug Wright & Adam Starr
---

Doug taught himself Ruby through the myriad of tools found on the great world wide web. Adam has been writing since he could pick up a pen. The project to write a children's book on learning Ruby came about from Twitter.

Doug noticed a friend's post about teaching his 6 year-old how to program with Python. Sharing a love for learning code, but unabashed favoritism for Ruby over Python, Doug suggested the father switch languages now before it was too late! But alas, though there is a _Python for Kids_ book, there is no equivalent for Ruby. Thus began the journey to create this book.
 
A few months later and here we are today with chapter one and more to come. Enjoy!
