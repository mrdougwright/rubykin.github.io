What is programming? 

Programing is language. We use language to communicate with our friends, and programming is simply a way of communicating with computers.

Learning a programming language is a lot like learning any language. First you start with the basic building blocks, the A, B, and Cs, then you start learning how to put those basic blocks into words, sentences, and eventually commands that tell your computer program what you want them to do.

Learning a programing language is fun, just like learning a foreign language. Once you learn a little bit of it, you can use it to communicate in an entirely new and exciting way.

Why do we need to speak a language to speak with computers?

Computers are a little bit like dogs, they are great companions, but you need to give them commands to tell them what you want them to do. There are a lot of different programing languages, just like their are a lot of foreign languages. But, instead of German and French and Spanish, programing languages are called things like .NET, and Node and Ruby and Python. This book will help you learn the basic Ruby language skills you need to start using the programing language called Ruby.

Programming code is used to give a computer a set of instructions, these instructions outline the plan or project, these instructions are similar to a blueprint for a house. Without a blueprint, builders wouldn’t know what the architect wants, just like the computer wouldn’t know how to create what you want. Is your house one or two stories, do you want it to be white or red? All of that information is given to the computer in the programing code, or instructions.

Let’s Start with the Basics. Why Integers and Floats are Like Ice Cream

  First, we’ll start by learning the general concepts of programming by looking at the Ruby language. Each chapter will go into more detail with basics at the beginning and more complicated material at the end. For now, let’s get started with some simple ideas.
  The computer understands two basic types of data, or information: numbers and strings. Numbers come in two tasty flavors. Integers, which are whole numbers without a decimal point, and floats, numbers that contain a decimal.

For example, these are integers: 

```ruby
1, 7, 0, 13, 2000
```

And these are floats:

```ruby
1.2, 3.14, 5.12345
```

Everytime you see a whole number like 8 or 19 you will know they are integers, and every time you see a number with a tasty sprinkle, or decimal, they will look like this 3.4 or 8.1 and you will know they are (rootbeer) floats.

Simple, right? Great job! Let’s move on.

The second type of data, or information that a computer understands are called strings. What’s a string? "Anything between quotes is called a string." Since that last sentence was inside of quotes, it was technically a string! Easy peezy. You probably see strings all the time without even realizing it! For example, have you ever seen an alert message on your computer saying this: "File does not exist!"

If so, then you my friend have seen a string. Strings are a little bit like backpacks or lunch pails, they are great for storing all the stuff we care about in an easy to carry container. Except with a string, the straps are the quotes. We use strings to store words, sentences, and even files. Here are some examples of strings:

```ruby
"I'm a string!"
"And_so_am_I"
"9"
```

9 is such a joker. Did you notice we put the number nine as a string? This is very different than the actual number nine, but we will get to that later.

Now that you know the two most fundamental pieces of data the computer uses (numbers and strings), it's time to dive a bit deeper into each of these data types.
