title: About Doug Wright
---

I taught myself Ruby through the myriad of tools found on the great world wide web. The project to write a children's book on learning Ruby came about from Twitter.

I noticed a friend's post about teaching his 6 year old programming with Python. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Python. But Ruby's syntax is so much easier to learn, I had to respond to my friend's tweet. I suggested he teach his kids Ruby.

The only problem was, there were no books for teaching kids programming with Ruby. I couldn't believe it. Not a single book. So I was inspired to write one myself. A few weeks later and here we are today with a simple website and a rough draft. More to come soon!
