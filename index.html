  <p>
    We are hard at work writing the first book on teaching kids Ruby! Why Ruby? Well, no one can argue that software is eating our world, and Ruby is one of the fastest growing languages of our time. Luckily, it's also one of the easiest and most fun to learn.

    Learning a programming language is like learning how to read and write during the middle ages. It is a special skill that will aid you for the times ahead. It will help you understand computers and the way they work. And as our world is overrun with computing power, those that harness that power will triumph.

    So why wait until high school or college to learn programming? Start teaching your kids now to better prepare them for their future.
